Clothing isn't just something you wear - it's a symbol of who you are. Our carefully handmade creations are mean't to help you rediscover the beauty of what was once overlooked.

        <h3>Seasons for Homeless</h3>
        <p><strong>About:</strong> Seasons for Homeless is a youth-led project based in San Jose that I hope to grow into a full organization. The idea is to support individuals and families experiencing homelessness through seasonal donation drives, community events, and volunteer-led activities. We plan to collect essentials like food, clothes, toiletries, toys, school supplies, and winter gear, while also offering opportunities for volunteers to help with meal prep, sorting donations, tutoring, arts and crafts for kids, game nights, and holiday celebrations. I also hope to host fundraising events, community dinners, and simple life-skills workshops like resume help and budgeting. Although it's not an official organization yet, my goal is to reach the right audience: people who care, want to get involved, and are looking for meaningful ways to earn volunteer hours while making a real difference.</p>
