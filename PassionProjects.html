Through collaborative research cohorts, mentorship from policy professionals, and real-world advocacy opportunities, PIVOT fellows are given the tools to turn their ideas into impact.

Our mission is to empower individuals to take control of their skin health and to fight for greater representation and inclusivity in sun safety and skincare.</p>
